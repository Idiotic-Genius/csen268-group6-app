# Flutter Game with Python Backend

Welcome to the **MAFIA - Murder Mystery in the Woods** repository!

A liitle bit about the game, it is a variant of the popular Mafia party/board game
with the one major difference being that the player plays with AI agent rather than
with other people. Thus, making it a single-player game.

The game takes place in a small town in the woods where murders have been plaguing the town,
you (the player) are an investigator who has been tasked to find and eliminate the killers.
You will need to converse with the townspeople to figure out whose lying or telling the truth
and determine based on their accounts who the killers are and save the town.
